When you write in a book, and find the last sentence, the last word, the last paragraph you want to write is at the end of the line and you really don&rsquo;t want to add any more writing. That&rsquo;s enough, done. Then the next day you write something new on a new sheet behind the previous pages.</p><p>Actually, I wanted to write this down last night. If so, maybe it would be a better and longer writing. Eventually, keep writing now. The euphoria is over. Today feels different from yesterday. But all is well. Time passed as usual. The weather is not much different from yesterday. And the neighbors still play the same genre of songs.</p></article></main><footer id=footer>Powered by Hugo and Github Page.</footer><script type=text/javascript src=https://akherlan.github.io/js/annotate.min.5b4a25824103cc64465094e19cc2320c441bfb502095d340b33f9b9b252657f00a1f08fdbb369fa15ca73ce0db9fb60e5f78935a6954e5d2371ef3e7b0a4b281.js integrity="sha512-W0olgkEDzGRGUJThnMIyDEQb+1AgldNAsz+bmyUmV/AKHwj9uzafoVynPODbn7YOX3iTWmlU5dI3HvPnsKSygQ=="></script></body></html>
